# Timer.sh
a simple timer written in shell script.


It's a simple timer.
Use option "-h" for hours, option "-m" for minutes and option "-s" for seconds.

example:
`$ ./Timer.sh -h 1 -m 10 -s 5 # Set a timer for 1 hour, 10 minutes and 5 secends.`

It works alright, but it still needs some work on handling invalid inputs.
